  "title": "Combinatorial Approximations for Cluster Deletion: Simpler, Faster, and Better",
  "summary": "The paper addresses the Cluster Deletion problem, aiming to efficiently partition a graph into cliques by deleting the fewest number of edges. The authors develop simpler, faster combinatorial algorithms that improve previous approximation guarantees from 4 to 3. Key innovations include deterministic degree-based pivoting strategies and a combinatorial method for solving LP relaxations using minimum cut reductions. Their methods are highly scalable and robust against noise, with broad applications in graph clustering tasks, including biological networks.",
  "classification": "Very helpful",
  "relevance": "The paper is highly relevant for designing SNP clustering algorithms, particularly for grouping SNPs based on association statistics while isolating noise clusters. Its methods for robust, scalable, noise-tolerant clustering closely align with the goals of constructing valid instrument clusters for Mendelian randomization studies. The emphasis on combinatorial techniques and noise handling is directly applicable to the challenges of genomic data analysis.",
