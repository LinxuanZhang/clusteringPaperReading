  "title": "Expand-and-Cluster: Parameter Recovery of Neural Networks",
  "summary": "This paper presents Expand-and-Cluster, a method for recovering the weights and structure of a neural network by training multiple overparameterized student networks to mimic a target (teacher) network. After training, neuron weight vectors are clustered to identify true underlying neurons, filtering out redundant or noise elements. They demonstrate that this method successfully recovers both shallow and deep networks across various activation functions, even under realistic noisy conditions. The method relies heavily on handling network symmetries and clustering based on neuron consistency.",
  "classification": "Likely helpful",
  "relevance": "While the paper does not deal directly with SNP clustering, its conceptual framework for identifying meaningful structure (neurons) and eliminating noise using a clustering approach after overparameterized training is highly relevant. These ideas can inform how to build robust clustering methods for SNP beta/Z-score data, particularly in distinguishing real biological signal from spurious noise clusters.",

  "additional_notes": "The idea of clustering consistency across multiple model trainings to identify real signals could be adapted to SNP clustering by checking for SNPs that consistently cluster across bootstrap samples or perturbations. Also, their methodology for dealing with scaling and sign ambiguity could be important if directionality is a concern for SNP effects."
