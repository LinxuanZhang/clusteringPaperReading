  "title": "Cluster-Aware Similarity Diffusion for Instance Retrieval",
  "summary": "This paper introduces Cluster-Aware Similarity (CAS) Diffusion, a re-ranking method for instance retrieval. Instead of propagating similarities globally, CAS restricts diffusion to local clusters formed by k-reciprocal nearest neighbors, minimizing the spread of noise from outliers. Two key techniques are used: Bidirectional Similarity Diffusion (BSD) for symmetric smoothing within local clusters, and Neighbor-guided Similarity Smooth (NSS) to enforce similarity consistency among neighbors. CAS achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark instance retrieval and re-identification datasets, demonstrating robust performance and efficient re-ranking with noise suppression.",
  "classification": "Likely helpful",
  "relevance": "The methods proposed are highly relevant to designing a clustering algorithm for SNPs, especially the emphasis on avoiding noise contamination during similarity propagation and ensuring local consistency. Although the paper addresses image retrieval rather than genomics, the cluster-aware diffusion concepts can be adapted for clustering SNPs based on their association statistics (e.g., Z-scores). Neighbor consistency techniques could help in distinguishing genuine signal clusters from noise clusters in genetic data.",
