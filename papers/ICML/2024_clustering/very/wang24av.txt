  "title": "MC-GTA: Metric-Constrained Model-Based Clustering using Goodness-of-fit Tests with Autocorrelations",
  "summary": "This paper proposes MC-GTA, a model-based clustering method that accounts for metric autocorrelation in data (e.g., spatial, temporal). It uses Wasserstein-2 distances between local Gaussian Markov Random Field models, fitting a generalized multivariate semivariogram to model autocorrelation. Clustering is formulated as minimizing a hinge loss based on goodness-of-fit tests. MC-GTA achieves better clustering quality, speed, and robustness compared to prior methods such as TICC and STICC.",
  "classification": "Very helpful",
  "relevance": "MC-GTA provides an innovative approach to clustering structured data by distinguishing meaningful clusters from noise via statistical goodness-of-fit tests. It offers methodological insights highly applicable to SNP clustering for Mendelian randomisation, especially for isolating noise clusters and capturing SNP correlation structures. Although developed for spatio-temporal data, its flexibility makes it directly adaptable to genomic contexts.",
