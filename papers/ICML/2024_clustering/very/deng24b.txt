  "title": "A3S: A General Active Clustering Method with Pairwise Constraints",
  "summary": "The paper introduces A3S (Adaptive Active Aggregation and Splitting), a scalable, general active clustering framework that improves clustering quality with minimal human queries. It first adaptively over-clusters data and then strategically merges or splits clusters based on expected gains in normalized mutual information (NMI), guided by a theoretical analysis. A3S demonstrates superior performance over traditional methods, requiring fewer queries and scaling effectively to large datasets, while robustly handling noise and outliers through strategic purity testing and transitive inference.",
  "classification": "Very helpful",
  "relevance": "The approach is highly applicable to SNP clustering in Mendelian randomization settings. The framework of adaptive over-clustering, strategic merging, splitting based on purity tests, and dynamic refinement aligns well with the needs of identifying meaningful SNP groups and filtering out noisy variants. Its theoretical and practical focus on noise handling, efficient computation, and large-scale clustering make it an excellent conceptual and methodological resource for developing SNP clustering algorithms that can also detect noise clusters.",
