  "title": "Correlation Clustering in Constantly Many Parallel Rounds",
  "summary": "The paper proposes a new parallel algorithm for correlation clustering that works in a constant number of rounds under the MPC model. It introduces a local notion of 'agreement' between nodes to trim weak edges and builds dense clusters by finding connected components in the trimmed graph. The method achieves a constant-factor approximation to the optimal clustering and is empirically shown to be much faster and comparably accurate compared to prior methods like Parallel Pivot and ClusterWild on massive datasets such as DBLP, UK-2005, and Twitter-2010.",
  "classification": "Likely helpful",
  "relevance": "Although primarily designed for general graphs and large-scale parallel systems, the paper introduces important concepts like agreement-based clustering and pruning of weak/noisy connections that could be very useful for SNP clustering based on beta/Z-score similarities. Adaptation would involve defining SNP pairwise agreement and tuning thresholds for noisy SNPs, but the lightweight, local decision-making nature of the algorithm fits well with goals like noise cluster isolation in MR studies.",
