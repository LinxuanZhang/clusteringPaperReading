  "title": "Systematic Analysis of Cluster Similarity Indices: How to Validate Validation Measures",
  "summary": "The paper investigates the problem of selecting the best clustering similarity index for evaluating clustering algorithms. It defines desirable theoretical properties like symmetry, monotonicity, and constant baseline, then systematically analyzes existing indices (e.g., Adjusted Rand, Mutual Information, Jaccard). The authors find that many popular indices are biased and propose alternatives like the Correlation Coefficient and a new Correlation Distance measure. They show that poor index choices can lead to degraded real-world system performance, and provide a practical guide for selecting appropriate validation indices.",
  "classification": "Likely helpful",
  "relevance": "While the paper does not focus on SNP-specific clustering, it provides an essential theoretical foundation for validating clustering outputs. Concepts like constant baseline and monotonicity are directly relevant to identifying and isolating noise clusters when clustering SNPs based on association statistics. It will be useful for designing internal validation metrics or evaluation steps to differentiate meaningful clusters from spurious ones in a causal inference setting.",
