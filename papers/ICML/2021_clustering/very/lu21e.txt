  "title": "ACE: Explaining Cluster from an Adversarial Perspective",
  "summary": "This paper introduces ACE, a deep learning framework that integrates low-dimensional embedding, clustering, and cluster explanation into a single optimization process. ACE neuralizes the clustering step, making cluster assignments differentiable, and uses adversarial perturbations to find minimal explanatory feature sets. Applied to single-cell RNA-seq data, ACE outperforms baseline methods in finding highly discriminative, non-redundant gene panels even under noisy conditions. It generalizes to other domains such as image recognition, suggesting its wide applicability for interpretable clustering tasks.",
  "classification": "Very helpful",
  "relevance": "This paper is highly relevant to the task of clustering SNPs for Mendelian randomisation. ACE's method of jointly embedding, clustering, and explaining clusters through adversarial perturbations could be adapted to beta/Z-score SNP data to find compact, meaningful SNP groups while detecting and isolating noise clusters. Its robustness to noise and high-dimensionality, and its emphasis on interpretable clustering, align strongly with the goals of pathway discovery and causal inference.",
