  "title": "Two-way Kernel Matrix Puncturing: towards resource-efficient PCA and spectral clustering",
  "summary": "This paper introduces a method for reducing computational and storage costs in PCA and spectral clustering by randomly puncturing (sparsifying) both the data and kernel matrices. Theoretical analysis shows that clustering and PCA performance are largely preserved even with significant puncturing, and phase transitions identify when degradation occurs. The approach is tested on synthetic and real-world image datasets, showing significant computational savings with minimal loss in accuracy.",
  "classification": "Likely helpful",
  "relevance": "The two-way puncturing method could inform the design of SNP clustering algorithms that must handle large datasets and noisy signals. While the paper's main focus is on computational efficiency rather than biological noise modeling, the ideas around preserving clustering structure despite heavy random sparsification are valuable. This suggests ways to robustly isolate true SNP clusters while identifying noise clusters based on stability and eigenvector behavior.",
