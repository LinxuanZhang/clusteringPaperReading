  "title": "One Pass Late Fusion Multi-View Clustering",
  "summary": "This paper introduces OP-LFMVC, an algorithm that unifies the learning of a consensus clustering matrix and the generation of cluster labels into a single optimization process. OP-LFMVC improves clustering quality and computational efficiency over previous multi-view clustering methods by tightly coupling partition learning and label generation. It is parameter-free, has provable convergence, and achieves strong generalization error bounds. Comprehensive experiments across benchmark datasets show it outperforms existing methods in clustering accuracy, robustness, and efficiency.",
  "classification": "Likely helpful",
  "relevance": "The unified optimization approach of OP-LFMVC could inspire designs for SNP clustering methods that avoid artifacts from post-hoc label assignment and detect meaningful clusters of SNPs based on association signals. Although OP-LFMVC is designed for multi-view data and not SNP-specific settings, its ideas around robustness, convergence guarantees, and tight partition-label coupling could help in developing specialized algorithms to detect and isolate noise clusters in causal inference studies like Mendelian randomisation.",
