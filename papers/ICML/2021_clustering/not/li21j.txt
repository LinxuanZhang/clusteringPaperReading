  "title": "Approximate Group Fairness for Clustering",
  "summary": "This paper introduces core fairness into the classical clustering problem, ensuring that no large coalition of points can significantly reduce their distance by deviating to a different center. They develop approximate fairness models, relaxing either the required coalition size or improvement, and design algorithms with provable guarantees for various types of metric spaces. Experiments show that their fair clustering methods improve group fairness while maintaining good clustering efficiency. Their ideas around fairness and coalition blocking could inform the design of more robust, noise-resistant clustering algorithms.",
  "classification": "Likely helpful",
  "relevance": "This paper could help in designing SNP clustering algorithms by inspiring fairness-based strategies to avoid noisy or dominant clusters. While it doesn't specifically model SNP beta/Z-score data or causal inference structures, its approximate fairness concepts and greedy algorithmic approaches could inform robustness mechanisms for isolating spurious signals. Adaptations would be needed to handle biological association data and SNP-specific challenges.",
