  "title": "Deep Safe Incomplete Multi-view Clustering: Theorem and Algorithm",
  "summary": "The paper presents DSIMVC, a framework for clustering incomplete multi-view data without degrading performance compared to clustering on only complete data. It introduces a bi-level optimization where missing views are imputed from learned semantic neighbors, and incomplete samples are weighted to reduce the impact of poor imputations. The framework offers theoretical guarantees on performance and shows superior experimental results across multiple datasets, even at high missingness rates.",
  "classification": "Likely helpful",
  "relevance": "Although designed for multi-view clustering, the methods proposed—especially robust sample weighting, dynamic neighbor mining, and safe learning guarantees—could be adapted for clustering SNPs using association measures where data are noisy or partially missing. These techniques could help isolate noise clusters and improve the stability of SNP cluster discovery for use in Mendelian randomisation, though domain-specific adjustments would be needed.",
