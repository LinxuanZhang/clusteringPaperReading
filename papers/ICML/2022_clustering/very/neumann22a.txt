  "title": "Sublinear-Time Clustering Oracle for Signed Graphs",
  "summary": "This paper presents a local clustering oracle for signed graphs that allows rapid classification of nodes into clusters without reading the full graph. It uses lazy signed random walks to build sparse vector representations of nodes and introduces a novel pseudometric for clustering based on spectral properties of the signed Laplacian. The method preprocesses in sublinear time and can correctly classify most vertices. Empirical evaluations show strong performance on synthetic and real-world datasets.",
  "classification": "Likely helpful",
  "relevance": "The paper's innovations in local clustering, random walk-based distance metrics, and noise robustness could be adapted to SNP clustering. While it targets signed social graphs, the concepts are transferable to designing clustering algorithms that handle signed or noisy SNP association data. Especially relevant are the use of spectral properties and random walk pseudometrics for detecting meaningful structures while avoiding spurious groupings.",
