  "title": "A Tighter Analysis of Spectral Clustering, and Beyond",
  "summary": "This paper studies classical spectral clustering, showing it works under weaker conditions than previously known. It also proposes using fewer eigenvectors than the number of clusters, leading to better performance in some settings. The concept of a 'meta-graph' is introduced to better represent cluster relations, and a stronger theoretical framework is developed to support these findings. Extensive empirical validation on synthetic and real-world datasets (BSDS, MNIST, USPS) demonstrates the practicality of the methods.",
  "classification": "Likely helpful",
  "relevance": "Although the paper addresses graph clustering rather than SNP feature clustering, it provides valuable insights on robust clustering under weak assumptions, handling noise via dimensionality reduction (fewer eigenvectors), and using meta-structures to guide clustering. These methods could inspire better distance metrics, embeddings, or robustness strategies for SNP clustering in Mendelian randomisation studies. However, adaptation would be required.",
