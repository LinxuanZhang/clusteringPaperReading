  "title": "Gradient Based Clustering",
  "summary": "This paper proposes a general and efficient clustering framework based on applying gradient steps to update cluster centers. Unlike traditional k-means which recomputes centers exactly, this method uses a single gradient step, enabling support for a wide range of cost functions, including robust losses like the Huber loss. The authors prove convergence guarantees even under arbitrary initialization and demonstrate strong robustness to noise in empirical experiments. The framework unifies and extends traditional k-means, Bregman clustering, and introduces a scalable way to handle complex, noise-robust clustering tasks.",
  "classification": "Very helpful",
  "relevance": "The paper's gradient-based, noise-tolerant clustering strategy is highly applicable to clustering SNPs by association measures such as beta or Z-scores. Its support for robust loss functions like the Huber loss directly helps in isolating meaningful SNP clusters from noise clusters. Furthermore, the method's flexibility in defining distances and costs allows customization for genetic association data. The strong theoretical guarantees make it a reliable foundation for building specialized SNP clustering algorithms for Mendelian randomization.",
