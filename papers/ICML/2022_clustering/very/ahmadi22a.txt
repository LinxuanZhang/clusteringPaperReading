  "title": "Individual Preference Stability for Clustering",
  "summary": "This paper introduces Individual Preference (IP) Stability, a new criterion for clustering where each point, on average, should be closer to points in its own cluster than points in any other cluster. The paper proves that finding an IP-stable clustering is NP-hard in general but provides efficient algorithms for special cases such as data on the real line or tree metrics. It also proposes approximation algorithms for nearly IP-stable clusterings, especially when clusters are well-separated. Extensive experiments show how existing algorithms (e.g., k-means++) perform with respect to IP-stability.",
  "classification": "Very helpful",
  "relevance": "The concept of IP-stability and the development of algorithms to find IP-stable or approximately IP-stable clusterings align strongly with the goals of designing a SNP clustering algorithm that can separate meaningful signals from noise. The paperâ€™s techniques to detect instability, tolerate approximate violations, and construct stable clusters are directly applicable to clustering SNPs based on their association measures for Mendelian randomization. Although the original focus is not on genomics, the underlying ideas are highly transferable.",
