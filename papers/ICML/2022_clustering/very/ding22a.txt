  "title": "Understanding Doubly Stochastic Clustering",
  "summary": "This paper analyzes the effect of projecting affinity matrices onto the space of doubly stochastic matrices under the ℓ2 norm, a normalization step shown empirically to improve clustering performance. It provides necessary and sufficient theoretical conditions for the resulting matrix to exhibit ideal clustering properties: no false connections between clusters and good within-cluster connectivity. The analysis extends to subspace clustering models, showing how geometric separation and data distribution affect outcomes. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets confirm the theoretical findings, demonstrating substantial improvements in clustering accuracy and noise reduction.",
  "classification": "Very helpful",
  "relevance": "The paper is highly relevant to SNP clustering for causal inference. It directly addresses how to process noisy similarity data to recover meaningful clusters and suppress spurious connections, matching the goal of identifying clean SNP clusters as instruments. Its theoretical results, normalization techniques, and practical denoising methods can be adapted to SNP association matrices (e.g., beta or Z-scores) to improve cluster quality and robustness.",
