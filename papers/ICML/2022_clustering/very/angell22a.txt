  "title": "Interactive Correlation Clustering with Existential Cluster Constraints",
  "summary": "The paper introduces existential cluster constraints (ECCs) as a new form of feedback for clustering problems. Instead of traditional must-link and cannot-link constraints, users express their mental model by specifying desired cluster-level features. The authors propose an efficient inference algorithm combining a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation and trellis-based dynamic programming to find clusterings that satisfy these constraints. Empirical results on author disambiguation tasks show that ECCs drastically reduce the amount of feedback needed to achieve high-quality clustering compared to traditional methods.",
  "classification": "Very helpful",
  "relevance": "The framework of specifying high-level cluster properties rather than point-to-point relationships is highly applicable to clustering SNPs for Mendelian randomization. SNP clusters can be guided by properties like association strength or biological pathway relevance. Additionally, the algorithmic approach (trellis-based optimization, SDP relaxation) offers scalable methods for clustering under complex noisy conditions, fitting your goal of detecting and isolating noise clusters in SNP association data.",
