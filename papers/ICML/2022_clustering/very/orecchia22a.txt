  "title": "Practical Nearly-Linear-Time Approximation Algorithms for Hybrid and Overlapping Graph Clustering",
  "summary": "The paper introduces efficient algorithms for finding overlapping and hybrid clusters in large graphs, based on new extensions of classical conductance-based partitioning objectives. It proposes the ε-overlapping ratio-cut and λ-hybrid ratio-cut formulations, designs scalable algorithms using s-t maximum flows and cut-matching games, and provides the first nearly-linear-time O(log n)-approximation algorithms for overlapping clustering. Extensive empirical evaluation shows the approach significantly outperforms existing methods on both synthetic and real-world networks.",
  "classification": "Very helpful",
  "relevance": "This paper is highly relevant for designing SNP clustering algorithms because it provides strategies for handling overlapping clusters (mirroring SNPs influencing multiple traits) and techniques for controlling noise through overlap constraints. While it assumes a graph structure, constructing a SNP-similarity graph from beta or Z-scores would allow direct application of these methods. The proposed algorithms are scalable to very large datasets, which is critical for genomic studies.",
