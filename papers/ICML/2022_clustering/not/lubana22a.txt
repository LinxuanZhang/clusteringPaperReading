  "title": "Orchestra: Unsupervised Federated Learning via Globally Consistent Clustering",
  "summary": "The paper proposes Orchestra, an unsupervised federated learning method that orchestrates a distributed clustering process to learn discriminative, privacy-preserving representations without labeled data. Clients perform local clustering on representations, send centroids to a server, which performs global clustering. This ensures globally consistent partitions and robust generalization, particularly under heterogeneity. Orchestra outperforms adaptations of centralized SSL methods (like SimCLR, BYOL) in cross-device federated settings, achieves communication efficiency, and scales well.",
  "classification": "Likely helpful",
  "relevance": "While not directly focused on SNP data or association measures, Orchestra's distributed clustering strategy, theoretical analysis of clusterability (inter-cluster mixing Î´), and robustness to data heterogeneity are potentially useful for designing SNP clustering algorithms. It offers insights into building scalable, noise-resistant clustering pipelines that could be adapted for SNP data contexts, especially when working with decentralized datasets or multiple cohorts.",
