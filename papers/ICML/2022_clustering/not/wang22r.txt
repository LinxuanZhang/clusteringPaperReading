  "title": "Convergence and Recovery Guarantees of the K-Subspaces Method for Subspace Clustering",
  "summary": "This paper analyzes the K-Subspaces (KSS) algorithm for clustering data lying in a union of overlapping subspaces. It proves that with a proper initialization (TIPS method based on thresholding inner products and spectral clustering), KSS converges superlinearly and achieves exact recovery in Θ(log log N) iterations. The paper presents strong theoretical results under a semi-random model and demonstrates through experiments that KSS is computationally efficient and competitive with state-of-the-art methods like sparse subspace clustering (SSC).",
  "classification": "Likely helpful",
  "relevance": "Although primarily designed for clustering data samples into subspaces, the principles of the KSS method — particularly its handling of overlapping structures, robustness to noise, and superlinear convergence after proper initialization — could be adapted for SNP clustering based on association patterns. The spectral initialization strategy (TIPS) and the simple yet powerful alternating updates could inspire methods to group SNPs by shared causal pathways while isolating noise clusters. Adaptations would be needed to tailor the distance/similarity measures to SNP beta or Z-score data.",
