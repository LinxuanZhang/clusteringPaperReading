  "title": "Massively Parallel k-Means Clustering for Perturbation Resilient Instances",
  "summary": "The paper presents scalable k-means clustering algorithms tailored for perturbation-resilient datasets in the Massively Parallel Computation (MPC) model. By leveraging Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to create near neighbor graphs and hierarchical cluster trees, the authors design dynamic programming algorithms that find exact or (1 + Îµ)-approximate solutions using O(1) parallel rounds. They bypass known lower bounds for general clustering problems by assuming the dataset has a stable underlying structure. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that the approach yields strong clustering performance even when perturbation resilience is imperfect.",
  "classification": "Very helpful",
  "relevance": "The paper is highly relevant to clustering SNPs for causal inference. Its focus on robust clustering of structured (stable) data aligns with the need to isolate true biological signal from noise in SNP association patterns. Techniques such as LSH-based neighbor detection, tree-based cluster construction, and stability assumptions could inform the design of a specialized SNP clustering algorithm capable of handling beta/Z-score data and detecting noise clusters.",
