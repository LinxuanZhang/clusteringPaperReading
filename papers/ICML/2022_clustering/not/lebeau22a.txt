  "title": "A Random Matrix Analysis of Data Stream Clustering: Coping With Limited Memory Resources",
  "summary": "This paper introduces an online kernel spectral clustering method for high-dimensional data streams under strict memory constraints. By modeling only a small subset of the Gram matrix via a Toeplitz mask, the authors leverage random matrix theory to derive when and how clustering remains effective despite heavy sparsification. They discover novel phase transition phenomena and propose an online clustering algorithm validated on real image datasets, achieving near-optimal performance with dramatically reduced memory usage.",
  "classification": "Likely helpful",
  "relevance": "The paper provides valuable insights into clustering noisy, high-dimensional data under memory constraints, using random matrix theory to rigorously analyze noise vs. signal eigenvalues. Although it does not address SNP-specific structures, it offers techniques (especially the handling of phase transitions and sparse kernel matrices) that could be adapted to design SNP clustering algorithms for Mendelian randomisation studies and noise isolation.",
