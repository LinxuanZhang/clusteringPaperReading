  "title": "Partial Optimality in Cubic Correlation Clustering",
  "summary": "The paper studies the cubic correlation clustering problem, which generalizes pairwise clustering to include triplet costs. It focuses on establishing partial optimality conditions that allow parts of the clustering solution to be fixed as optimal before full optimization. The authors design efficient algorithms for detecting such conditions by reducing subproblems to min-cut problems. Experiments show that these methods can fix a large fraction of variables efficiently on synthetic and geometric datasets, particularly under low noise conditions.",
  "classification": "Likely helpful",
  "relevance": "The paper introduces partial optimality methods that can potentially be adapted for clustering SNPs based on association measures like beta or Z-scores, particularly to prune spurious or noise-driven clusters. Although their main focus is on triplet (cubic) interactions and complete graphs, the algorithmic strategies and general approach to early noise removal and cluster fixing could inspire methods in SNP clustering for Mendelian randomisation studies.",
