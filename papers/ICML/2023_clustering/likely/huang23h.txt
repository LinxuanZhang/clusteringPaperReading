  "title": "On Coresets for Clustering in Small Dimensional Euclidean Spaces",
  "summary": "The paper explores the construction of small coresets for the k-median clustering problem in small-dimensional Euclidean spaces. It provides nearly tight upper and lower bounds for coreset sizes, showing improved constructions for 1D (Õ(ε⁻¹/²) size) and introducing discrepancy-based methods for higher dimensions. The authors present both theoretical improvements and practical constructions, highlighting how smaller coresets can accelerate clustering algorithms, reduce memory needs, and enable more efficient streaming and distributed computations.",
  "classification": "Likely helpful",
  "relevance": "While the paper does not directly address clustering SNPs based on association scores or noise cluster detection, its techniques for creating small coresets that preserve clustering quality could inspire efficient preprocessing pipelines for large SNP datasets. Coreset methods would be particularly useful if computational scaling becomes a bottleneck. The adaptive error management strategies might also be adaptable for selecting SNPs based on association strength.",
