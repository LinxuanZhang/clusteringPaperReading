  "title": "Cluster Explanation via Polyhedral Descriptions",
  "summary": "This paper introduces a new method to explain clusters in a dataset by constructing polyhedra (geometric shapes formed by intersections of half-spaces) around each cluster. The method formulates the problem as an integer program to optimize for low complexity (few conditions) or sparsity (few features). It uses column generation to handle the exponentially large search space of possible separating half-spaces and introduces a grouping technique to scale to large datasets. Empirical results show the approach outperforms decision-tree-based and prototype-based cluster explanations in both accuracy and interpretability on multiple benchmark datasets.",
  "classification": "Likely helpful",
  "relevance": "While the paper does not propose clustering methods or directly address noise detection, it introduces techniques for compact and interpretable post-clustering explanations. These could be adapted to SNP clustering scenarios where one needs to summarize or validate SNP groups for use in causal inference frameworks. The ideas around minimizing complexity and handling large data with principled grouping could inspire steps for interpreting SNP clusters and filtering noise.",
