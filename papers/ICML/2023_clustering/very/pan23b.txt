  "title": "Beyond Homophily: Reconstructing Structure for Graph-agnostic Clustering",
  "summary": "This paper presents DGCN, a graph-agnostic clustering framework that addresses the challenge of clustering nodes without prior knowledge of graph homophily. It reconstructs two auxiliary graphs (homophilic and heterophilic) from the original data, applies a mixed low- and high-frequency filter, and decouples the learned embeddings into separate attribute and structure spaces. DGCN achieves state-of-the-art clustering performance across both homophilic and heterophilic graphs.",
  "classification": "Very helpful",
  "relevance": "The methods proposed in this paper are highly relevant for SNP clustering. The idea of reconstructing homophilic and heterophilic graphs maps well onto constructing similarity and dissimilarity matrices from beta/Z-score associations. Mixed filtering techniques and dual embedding spaces offer novel ways to capture robust SNP clusters while isolating noise, critical for building meaningful instruments for Mendelian randomization.",
