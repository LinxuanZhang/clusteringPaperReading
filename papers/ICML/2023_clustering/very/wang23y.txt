  "title": "GC-Flow: A Graph-Based Flow Network for Effective Clustering",
  "summary": "The paper proposes GC-Flow, a generative graph neural network that replaces GCN layers with normalizing flows to improve clustering quality. By modeling p(x|y)p(y) instead of p(y|x), GC-Flow structures the representation space into a Gaussian mixture, yielding well-separated clusters while maintaining strong classification performance. It integrates graph convolutions within the flow architecture and proposes a determinant lemma to efficiently handle graph-induced dependencies. Extensive experiments show superior clustering on benchmark datasets.",
  "classification": "Very helpful",
  "relevance": "GC-Flowâ€™s generative approach to structuring latent spaces into clusters is directly applicable to clustering SNP-level data based on association scores. It offers techniques for separating signal from noise in embedding spaces, which matches the goal of isolating meaningful SNP clusters for Mendelian randomisation. Its management of graph structure could inform modeling of SNP correlation structures (e.g., linkage disequilibrium).",
