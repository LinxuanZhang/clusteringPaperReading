  "title": "Optimal LP Rounding and Linear-Time Approximation Algorithms for Clustering Edge-Colored Hypergraphs",
  "summary": "This paper improves algorithms for clustering edge-colored hypergraphs, aiming to minimize 'mistakes' where node groupings don't match hyperedge colors. The authors design an optimal LP rounding method and fast combinatorial algorithms with tight theoretical guarantees. Key contributions include a randomized LP rounding technique using thresholds, matching integrality gap proofs, and reductions to known problems like Vertex Cover.",
  "classification": "Very helpful",
  "relevance": "While not directly focused on SNPs, the paper introduces concepts highly applicable to SNP clustering in Mendelian randomisation studies. Its emphasis on minimizing noisy cluster assignments, tight LP rounding, and scalable combinatorial strategies can inspire specialized SNP clustering algorithms that separate meaningful genetic signals from noise.",
