  "title": "Deep Clustering with Incomplete Noisy Pairwise Annotations: A Geometric Regularization Approach",
  "summary": "The paper addresses the problem of clustering with incomplete and noisy pairwise annotations by proposing a geometric regularization approach for deep constrained clustering (DCC). It analyzes the identifiability properties of logistic loss in DCC, introduces a confusion matrix to model annotation noise, and proposes the VolMaxDCC method, which uses volume maximization to ensure robust and generalizable clustering. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that VolMaxDCC significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in noisy annotation settings.",
  "classification": "Very helpful",
  "relevance": "This paper is highly relevant because it addresses clustering under noisy annotations, a situation very similar to clustering SNPs based on noisy beta or Z-scores. The geometric regularization method proposed could directly inspire mechanisms for detecting and isolating 'noise clusters' in genetic association studies, which is crucial for building reliable instruments for Mendelian randomization.",
