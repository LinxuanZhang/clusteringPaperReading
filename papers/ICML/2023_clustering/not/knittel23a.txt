  "title": "Generalized Reductions: Making any Hierarchical Clustering Fair and Balanced with Low Cost",
  "summary": "This paper introduces a series of algorithms that modify existing hierarchical clusterings to make them fair and balanced, with minimal increase in clustering cost (measured by Dasgupta’s cost function). It proposes simple tree operators like rebalancing, subtree insertion, level abstraction, and tree folding, and combines them to achieve deterministic and stochastic fairness under broad constraints. The methods substantially improve the previous approximation factors for fairness while maintaining explainable changes to clustering structure. Experiments on real-world datasets confirm the theoretical results.",
  "classification": "Unlikely helpful",
  "relevance": "The paper’s focus on fairness constraints in hierarchical clustering is not directly applicable to the goal of clustering SNPs based on association signals for Mendelian randomisation. While the techniques for rebalancing and modifying trees might inspire very general ideas for structure-preserving adjustments, the main methods and objectives are not aligned with detecting meaningful SNP clusters or isolating noise. Thus, the paper is unlikely to provide directly usable methods for your specific project.",
