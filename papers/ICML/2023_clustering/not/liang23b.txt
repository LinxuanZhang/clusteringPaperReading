  "title": "Consistency of Multiple Kernel Clustering",
  "summary": "This paper theoretically analyzes the consistency of kernel weights in multiple kernel clustering (MKC), introducing SimpleMKKM. The authors derive a non-asymptotic convergence bound of the kernel weights and establish an excess clustering risk bound. They also propose a Nystrom-based scalable MKC method with theoretical learning guarantees, allowing efficient clustering of large datasets. Extensive experiments on benchmark and large-scale datasets validate their theoretical results.",
  "classification": "Likely helpful",
  "relevance": "The paper provides valuable insights into clustering stability and consistency, which could inspire methods to detect robust SNP clusters and distinguish them from noise clusters. While the focus is not on SNPs or association scores directly, the theoretical foundations of consistent clustering and scalable extensions are applicable. However, the heavy focus on multiple kernel methods makes it less directly relevant unless kernels are part of the SNP clustering strategy.",
