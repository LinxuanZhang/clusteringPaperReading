  "title": "Spurious Valleys and Clustering Behavior of Neural Networks",
  "summary": "This paper investigates the geometry of the loss landscapes of neural networks. It proves explicit size bounds for hidden layers to avoid spurious valleys, ensuring that gradient descent reaches global minima. Additionally, it introduces a novel method for assessing whether a neural network can represent a target function by studying the clustering behavior of critical error values across translated training datasets. These clusters reveal information about model expressiveness and the presence of spurious minima.",
  "classification": "Likely helpful",
  "relevance": "While not directly applicable to clustering SNP beta/Z-scores, the paper's insights into detecting clusters of meaningful versus spurious structures in high-dimensional spaces could inform strategies for distinguishing real from noise clusters in SNP data. The idea of tracking cluster behavior under perturbations could be adapted for robustness testing of SNP clusters as instruments.",
