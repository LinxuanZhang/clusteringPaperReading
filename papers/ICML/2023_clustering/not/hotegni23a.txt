  "title": "Approximation Algorithms for Fair Range Clustering",
  "summary": "The paper introduces a clustering framework called fair range clustering, where clusters must fairly represent different demographic groups within flexible ranges rather than fixed quotas. The authors develop constant-factor approximation algorithms for this problem across various â„“p-objectives (like k-means, k-median, k-center). They design efficient algorithms using LP-relaxation, sparsification, rounding via network flow, and polyhedral combinatorics. Their approach improves clustering quality over strict fairness models and offers theoretical guarantees of performance.",
  "classification": "Likely helpful",
  "relevance": "Although the paper does not address clustering SNP data or noise detection directly, it presents strong methodological ideas around clustering under structural constraints using LP relaxations, sparsification, and rounding techniques. These strategies may inspire designs for SNP clustering algorithms that handle structured grouping or pathway-based constraints. However, it is not focused on association score clustering or detecting noisy clusters, limiting its direct applicability.",
