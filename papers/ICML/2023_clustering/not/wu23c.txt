  "title": "Effective Neural Topic Modeling with Embedding Clustering Regularization",
  "summary": "The paper introduces ECRTM (Embedding Clustering Regularization Topic Model) to solve the problem of topic collapsing in neural topic models. By applying a novel Embedding Clustering Regularization (ECR) based on optimal transport, the model forces topic embeddings to act as centers of separately aggregated clusters of word embeddings. This produces distinct, non-redundant topics. ECRTM outperforms state-of-the-art models on topic quality, diversity, and downstream classification tasks across multiple datasets.",
  "classification": "Likely helpful",
  "relevance": "The paper is relevant because it addresses the issue of collapsed, redundant clusters through embedding regularization techniques, which is conceptually similar to isolating spurious noise clusters when clustering SNPs. Although it focuses on topic modeling of text, the embedding regularization and optimal transport methods could be adapted for clustering SNP-level data based on association measures.",
