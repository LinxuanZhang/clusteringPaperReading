  "title": "Near-Optimal Quantum Coreset Construction Algorithms for Clustering",
  "summary": "This paper develops a quantum algorithm for constructing coresets for k-clustering problems like k-median and k-means. The proposed method uses quantum approximate nearest neighbor search and quantum summation to reduce dataset size significantly while preserving clustering structure within a small approximation error. The approach achieves a near-quadratic speedup over classical methods, with matching lower bounds confirming near-optimality. A novel multidimensional quantum approximate summation subroutine is introduced, offering a potentially wide application in quantum machine learning.",
  "classification": "Likely helpful",
  "relevance": "The concept of constructing a small, representative subset (coreset) is relevant for clustering SNPs with association measures. Although tailored for Euclidean clustering and using quantum methods, the underlying principles of scalable, approximate clustering and robust group formation could inspire techniques for SNP-level clustering in causal inference frameworks. However, practical use would require adaptation to classical environments and non-Euclidean distances typical in SNP analyses.",
