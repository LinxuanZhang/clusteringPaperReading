  "title": "Evolutionary Diversity Optimization with Clustering-Based Selection for Reinforcement Learning (EDO-CS)",
  "summary": "This paper introduces EDO-CS, an evolutionary algorithm designed to find a set of policies that are both high-quality and behaviorally diverse in reinforcement learning. EDO-CS clusters candidate policies by their behavioral features and selects the best-performing policy from each cluster to encourage exploration across diverse strategies while maintaining high rewards. It uses evolution strategies for policy updates and a multi-armed bandit model to dynamically adjust the balance between quality and diversity. EDO-CS outperforms previous quality-diversity methods across deceptive, multi-modal, and standard reinforcement learning tasks.",
  "classification": "Very helpful",
  "relevance": "The clustering-first selection approach and adaptive diversity-quality balancing presented in EDO-CS directly align with the challenges of clustering SNPs based on association measures. These methods could help design algorithms that group SNPs into meaningful clusters for use as instruments in Mendelian randomization while filtering out noise clusters. The archive management and dynamic parameter tuning strategies are particularly well-suited for handling the noisy, high-dimensional nature of SNP data.",

  ],
  "notes": [
    "Clustering SNPs first before selecting representative instruments could avoid dominance by noise or overly strong effects",
    "Multi-armed bandit adjustment of Î» could inform adaptive penalization of cluster homogeneity or signal strength",
    "Persistence of high-quality diverse clusters in an archive mirrors keeping pathways or functional groups intact",
    "Would require adapting behavior space definition to SNP features (e.g., multi-trait betas or Z-score vectors)"
