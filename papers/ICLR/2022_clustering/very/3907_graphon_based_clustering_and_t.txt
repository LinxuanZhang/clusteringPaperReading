  "title": "Graphon Based Clustering and Testing of Networks: Algorithms and Theory",
  "summary": "This paper introduces a new graphon-based framework for clustering network-valued data and performing two-sample testing, particularly when graphs lack vertex correspondence. It defines a novel distance between graphs by estimating their underlying graphons through sorting-and-smoothing transformations and measuring their L2-distance. Two clustering algorithms are proposed: Distance-based Spectral Clustering (DSC) and Similarity-based Semi-Definite Programming (SSDP), both with theoretical consistency guarantees. Experiments on simulated and real-world data show that their methods outperform graph kernels and graph matching approaches in accuracy and scalability, especially in small sample, large graph settings.",
  "classification": "Very helpful",
  "relevance": "The theoretical framework and practical algorithms developed in this paper are highly applicable to clustering SNPs based on association measures like beta or Z-scores. SNP data, like networks without vertex correspondence, involves complex, high-dimensional, and noisy structures. Adapting the graphon-based distance and clustering methods could help isolate meaningful SNP clusters representing causal pathways and detect noise clusters. The focus on statistical consistency in small sample, high-dimensional regimes is especially aligned with challenges in Mendelian randomization projects.",
