  "title": "ADA-NETS: Face Clustering via Adaptive Neighbour Discovery in the Structure Space",
  "summary": "This paper presents ADA-NETS, a novel face clustering method that builds cleaner graphs by transforming features into a structure space and dynamically learning the number of neighbor connections for each data point. The method addresses the common problem of noise edges in graph construction, using a heuristic quality-driven adaptive filter based on an Fβ-score and a robust similarity metric combining cosine and Jaccard similarities. ADA-NETS achieves state-of-the-art clustering results on several datasets, showing strong generalization and robustness against noisy input data.",
  "classification": "Very helpful",
  "relevance": "The problems addressed (noise handling, graph construction, clustering continuous noisy data) directly mirror the challenges in SNP clustering for causal inference. The adaptive neighbor discovery and structure space methods could be adapted to SNP beta/Z-score data, helping detect true biological pathways while isolating spurious noise clusters.",
