  "title": "A Deep Variational Approach to Clustering Survival Data",
  "summary": "This paper introduces VaDeSC, a semi-supervised probabilistic model that clusters survival data by jointly modeling explanatory variables and censored survival outcomes using a deep variational autoencoder with a Gaussian mixture prior. Survival times are modeled with cluster-specific Weibull distributions. The model optimizes an evidence lower bound (ELBO) to efficiently learn both feature and outcome distributions. VaDeSC outperforms existing survival clustering methods on synthetic and real-world datasets, including clinical imaging data, and offers interpretable, structured clustering that reflects both covariates and outcomes.",
  "classification": "Very helpful",
  "relevance": "The method's core innovations — joint modeling of continuous noisy inputs with outcomes, probabilistic clustering with latent variables, and robust variational optimization — are directly applicable to clustering SNPs using beta/Z-scores for causal inference. The emphasis on detecting different underlying mechanisms rather than mere outcome differences is especially aligned with pathway identification in Mendelian randomization. With adaptation, VaDeSC could form a powerful basis for SNP clustering with noise cluster isolation.",
