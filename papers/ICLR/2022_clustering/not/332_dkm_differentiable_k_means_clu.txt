  "title": "DKM: Differentiable k-Means Clustering Layer for Neural Network Compression",
  "summary": "This paper proposes DKM, a differentiable k-means clustering layer designed for compressing deep neural networks. Instead of hard cluster assignment, DKM uses an attention mechanism to softly assign weights to centroids and refines them through training to minimize task loss. DKM enables better compression-accuracy trade-offs than traditional clustering or quantization approaches, particularly in low-bit regimes, and can handle multi-dimensional clustering for enhanced model capacity.",
  "classification": "Likely helpful",
  "relevance": "Although DKM is applied to neural network compression, its core method—differentiable, attention-based soft clustering—is highly relevant for clustering continuous SNP data like beta or Z-scores. The soft assignment could help detect weak or noisy signals, and temperature-based tuning could help isolate noise clusters. However, direct application would need significant adaptation to biological causal inference contexts.",
