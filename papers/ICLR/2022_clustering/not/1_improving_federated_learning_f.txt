  "title": "Improving Federated Learning Face Recognition via Privacy-Agnostic Clusters",
  "summary": "The paper proposes PrivacyFace, a framework that enhances federated learning for face recognition without compromising privacy. It introduces Differentially Private Local Clustering (DPLC) to create sanitized, privacy-agnostic clusters of local class centers, and a consensus-aware loss to align client models globally. These innovations significantly boost model performance (+9.63% and +10.26% TAR@FAR=1e-4 on IJB-B and IJB-C) while preserving differential privacy with minimal computational cost.",
  "classification": "Likely helpful",
  "relevance": "While the paper focuses on federated learning for face recognition, its approach to clustering sensitive data with strong privacy guarantees and managing noisy clusters could inform strategies for clustering SNP-level beta/Z-score data. Concepts like privacy-agnostic clustering and consensus-aware optimization could inspire designs to robustly cluster meaningful SNP signals while identifying noise clusters.",
