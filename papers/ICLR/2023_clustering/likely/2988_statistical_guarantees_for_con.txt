  "title": "Statistical Guarantees for Consensus Clustering",
  "summary": "This paper tackles the problem of combining multiple different clusterings of the same data (where labels might be permuted) into a robust consensus clustering. It proposes lifting the clustering to the association matrix space to avoid label-switching problems and applies aggregation techniques like K-means and spectral clustering. A random perturbation model is introduced to formally analyze noise, and a local refinement step is shown to achieve nearly optimal error rates. Empirical experiments validate that their methods outperform existing approaches, especially under noisy or unbalanced conditions.",
  "classification": "Very helpful",
  "relevance": "The techniques introduced — clustering in association matrix space, statistical noise modeling, and local refinement — are directly applicable to clustering SNPs based on association measures like beta or Z-scores. The focus on noise robustness and optimal statistical performance aligns well with the goal of designing algorithms that can isolate meaningful SNP groups while filtering noise clusters.",
