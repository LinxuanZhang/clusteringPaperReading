  "title": "The Hidden Uniform Cluster Prior in Self-Supervised Learning",
  "summary": "This paper reveals that many popular self-supervised learning methods (e.g., SimCLR, VICReg, SwAV, MSN) unintentionally impose a uniform clustering prior on the learned features, favoring equal-sized clusters. While effective on class-balanced datasets like ImageNet, this uniformity bias severely degrades performance on real-world, class-imbalanced datasets that follow long-tailed distributions. The authors propose Prior Matching for Siamese Networks (PMSN), which allows arbitrary priors (e.g., power-law) instead of uniform. They show, through theoretical analysis, toy experiments, and large-scale evaluations (iNaturalist18, ImageNet), that matching the prior to the data distribution improves learned representations and downstream task performance.",
  "classification": "Very helpful",
  "relevance": "The paper's identification of hidden uniform priors in clustering and the proposed correction through prior matching are highly relevant for SNP clustering. SNP effect sizes are inherently heavy-tailed, not uniformly distributed. Adapting prior matching strategies (e.g., using power-law distributions) can help design more accurate clustering algorithms that identify meaningful SNP groups while detecting and isolating noise clusters.",
