  "title": "Robust Fair Clustering: A Novel Fairness Attack and Defense Framework",
  "summary": "This paper investigates whether existing fair clustering algorithms are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that degrade fairness without harming clustering accuracy. It introduces a novel black-box fairness attack by perturbing protected group memberships and shows that state-of-the-art fair clustering algorithms are highly vulnerable. To counter this, they propose Consensus Fair Clustering (CFC), a robust method that transforms consensus clustering into a fair graph partitioning problem, combining self-supervised contrastive learning and fairness loss to resist attacks. CFC outperforms traditional methods under adversarial conditions across multiple datasets.",
  "classification": "Likely helpful",
  "relevance": "Although the paper is centered on fairness in clustering demographic groups, the techniques for robust clustering against perturbations are conceptually relevant to clustering SNPs with noisy beta/Z-scores. Especially, the consensus clustering framework and noise-resilient embedding learning strategies could inspire approaches for identifying real SNP clusters versus noise clusters. Direct application is limited because the original work does not address SNPs or association measures.",
