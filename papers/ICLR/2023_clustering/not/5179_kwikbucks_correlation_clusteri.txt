  "title": "KWIKBUCKS: Correlation Clustering with Cheap-Weak and Expensive-Strong Signals",
  "summary": "The paper introduces KwikBucks, a novel algorithm for budgeted correlation clustering when similarities are available from two sources: an expensive, accurate oracle and a cheaper, weaker oracle. KwikBucks uses the cheap signal to prioritize and minimize strong queries while extending the classical KwikCluster framework. It offers both theoretical guarantees and practical efficiency, demonstrating large improvements in clustering quality and query reduction across diverse datasets. The strategy of using weak signals to guide expensive queries can be adapted to noisy SNP data clustering.",
  "classification": "Very helpful",
  "relevance": "KwikBucks directly informs the design of specialized SNP clustering algorithms by addressing key challenges: noisy similarity measures (cheap SNP association scores), limited access to strong validations (biological MR instruments), and the need to isolate noise clusters. Techniques like ranking weak signals, controlling query budgets, and robust clustering under imperfect signals align closely with the goal of clustering SNPs for Mendelian randomization.",
