  "title": "Incompatibility Clustering as a Defense Against Backdoor Poisoning Attacks",
  "summary": "This paper introduces a new clustering approach based on an incompatibility property between data subsets: training on one subset should not improve performance on another if they are incompatible. Using a self-expansion measure, the authors iteratively trim and refine clusters through an Inverse Self-Paced Learning algorithm. A boosting procedure is then used to identify clean clusters. The method is evaluated on image datasets (CIFAR-10, GTSRB) for defending against various backdoor attacks, achieving below 1% attack success in most cases with minimal clean accuracy loss.",
  "classification": "Very helpful",
  "relevance": "The incompatibility-based clustering approach is highly relevant for SNP clustering based on association statistics like beta or Z-scores. It offers a method to detect meaningful clusters based on functional consistency rather than raw similarity, allowing for the separation of real signals from noise clusters. The iterative trimming and boosting strategies are also applicable to refining SNP groupings for use in Mendelian randomization analyses.",
