  "title": "Near-Optimal Coresets for Robust Clustering",
  "summary": "This paper presents a near-optimal method for constructing ε-coresets for robust clustering problems (k-median and k-means) with a known number of outliers. Their method isolates outliers and partitions inliers into geometric structures called rings and groups, applying careful sampling to preserve clustering objectives within ε-relative error. Their coresets significantly outperform prior baselines in accuracy and efficiency, achieving consistent low error and substantial speedups in real-world datasets. They also prove that their dependence on the number of outliers is nearly theoretically optimal.",
  "classification": "Very helpful",
  "relevance": "The paper's focus on robust clustering with outlier handling, its efficient coreset construction method, and its theoretical guarantees align very closely with the goals of clustering SNPs based on beta/Z-scores while detecting and isolating noise clusters. Adapting their framework could allow scalable and noise-tolerant SNP clustering to build strong instruments for Mendelian randomization.",
