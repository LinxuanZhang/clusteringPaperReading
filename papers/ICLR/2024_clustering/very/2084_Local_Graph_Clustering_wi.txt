  "title": "Local Graph Clustering with Noisy Labels",
  "summary": "The paper introduces a novel local graph clustering method using noisy node labels. By constructing a weighted graph where edges between nodes with differing labels are penalized, the method improves clustering accuracy significantly compared to traditional diffusion-based approaches. Theoretical analysis provides conditions under which this method is effective, and empirical tests on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate substantial performance improvements.",
  "classification": "Very helpful",
  "relevance": "This paper is highly relevant to your goal of designing clustering algorithms for SNP data. The proposed technique of handling noisy labels via weighted graphs aligns well with your aim to detect and isolate noise clusters. Additionally, the theoretical insights and performance benchmarks are likely to be directly applicable to your project.",
