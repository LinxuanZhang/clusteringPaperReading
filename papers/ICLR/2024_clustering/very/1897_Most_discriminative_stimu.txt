    "title": "Most Discriminative Stimuli for Functional Cell Type Clustering",
    "summary": "The paper presents a novel clustering algorithm designed to identify functional cell types in the retina and visual cortex by optimizing stimuli (Most Discriminative Stimuli, MDS) that elicit distinct responses from specific neuron groups while suppressing others. The approach involves an EM-style algorithm that alternates between optimizing stimuli for each cluster and reassigning neurons to their most responsive stimuli. This clustering algorithm is validated across species (mouse, marmoset, macaque) and recording techniques. It shows faster and more efficient identification of functional types compared to conventional methods, saving about 20% of experimental time. The algorithm is robust across initializations and provides interpretable results through visual representations of the optimized stimuli.",
    "classification": "Very helpful",
    "relevance": "The optimization-based clustering approach presented in this paper is highly relevant for SNP clustering. Its EM-style methodology of alternating between optimization and reassignment can be adapted for clustering SNPs based on statistical signals like beta/Z-scores. The approachâ€™s emphasis on isolating noise and providing directly interpretable clusters is particularly suitable for identifying meaningful SNP clusters and distinguishing them from noise clusters.",
