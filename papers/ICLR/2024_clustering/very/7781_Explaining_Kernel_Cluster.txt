  "title": "Explaining Kernel Clustering via Decision Trees",
  "summary": "This paper extends recent progress in explainable k-means clustering to the kernel setting by proposing Kernel IMM. It constructs an axis-aligned decision tree that approximates kernel k-means partitions while remaining interpretable. Central to the approach is a surrogate feature map, ensuring threshold splits in the original input space. The authors provide theoretical guarantees on the \"price of explainability,\" showing near-optimal kernel cluster quality can be preserved. They also present greedy refinements (Kernel ExKMC, Kernel Expand) to improve clustering accuracy, with the trade-off of deeper trees. Empirical results demonstrate the methodâ€™s effectiveness on synthetic and real datasets, often rivaling non-interpretable kernel k-means performance.",
  "classification": "Likely helpful",
  "relevance": "Crucial for researchers/practitioners requiring interpretable but flexible clustering. By bridging kernel clustering with decision trees, it addresses real-world data that are not linearly separable, while maintaining worst-case approximation guarantees on interpretability.",
