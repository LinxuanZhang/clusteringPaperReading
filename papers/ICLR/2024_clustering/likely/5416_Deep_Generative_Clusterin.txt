  "title": "Deep Generative Clustering with Multimodal Diffusion Variational Autoencoders",
  "summary": "This paper introduces CMVAE, a multimodal VAE that enforces a clustering structure in the latent space by using a mixture-based prior. It includes a post-hoc method to automatically select the optimal number of clusters via an entropy-based criterion. The authors also incorporate diffusion probabilistic models to refine generated samples, leading to sharper and more realistic outputs. Experiments on image-text data show improved clustering accuracy, generative quality, and flexibility in handling missing modalities compared to earlier multimodal VAEs.",
  "classification": "Likely helpful",
  "relevance": "While the paper focuses on images and text, the underlying clustering strategies (use of mixture priors, post-hoc pruning of extraneous clusters, and robust generative modeling) may inform SNP clustering approaches. However, adapting it to beta/Z-scores and SNP-specific noise detection would require tailored distance measures and domain-specific validation.",
