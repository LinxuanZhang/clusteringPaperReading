  "title": "A Critique of Self-Expressive Deep Subspace Clustering",
  "summary": "This paper critically analyzes Self-Expressive Deep Subspace Clustering (SEDSC) methods, which combine autoencoders with a self-expressive loss for unsupervised clustering. It shows that the standard formulations are often ill-posed and lead to trivial or degenerate embeddings rather than meaningful clusters. Empirical results suggest that previous successes of SEDSC can largely be attributed to ad-hoc post-processing steps, rather than the model itself. The paper concludes that significant theoretical and methodological improvements are needed to make these methods robust.",
  "classification": "Likely helpful",
  "relevance": "Although the paper does not introduce a new clustering method, it highlights critical failure modes and theoretical pitfalls in joint embedding-and-clustering approaches. These warnings are highly relevant if you plan to cluster SNPs based on association measures and use latent embeddings. Avoiding trivial embeddings, carefully designing regularizations, and ensuring that meaningful structures are learned (rather than post-processed artifacts) will be crucial for your project.",
