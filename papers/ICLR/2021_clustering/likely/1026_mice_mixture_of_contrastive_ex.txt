  "title": "MiCE: Mixture of Contrastive Experts for Unsupervised Image Clustering",
  "summary": "This paper proposes MiCE, a clustering framework that combines contrastive learning with a latent mixture model to jointly learn data representations and cluster assignments. MiCE uses a gating function to partition the data among specialized 'experts' and applies an EM-like optimization procedure to maximize a single probabilistic objective. Empirical results show that MiCE outperforms other unsupervised clustering methods on several image datasets, and that jointly learning embeddings and clusters improves clustering quality significantly.",
  "classification": "Likely helpful",
  "relevance": "MiCE introduces a principled approach to joint representation learning and clustering using a probabilistic model with latent variables. Its framework could inspire designs for SNP clustering algorithms that need to detect real versus noise clusters based on association strengths. However, adaptations are needed because MiCE is built for image data and contrastive learning tasks, not SNP-level association data like betas or Z-scores.",
