  "title": "Clustering-Friendly Representation Learning via Instance Discrimination and Feature Decorrelation",
  "summary": "The paper introduces IDFD, a deep learning framework for learning clustering-friendly representations by combining instance discrimination and feature decorrelation. It uses a softmax-based decorrelation constraint to stabilize learning, and shows that proper temperature tuning allows the model to approximate the behavior of spectral clustering. Empirical results on image datasets like CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-10 show that IDFD outperforms traditional and recent deep clustering methods, achieving stable and high-quality clustering performance.",
  "classification": "Likely helpful",
  "relevance": "The IDFD method is highly relevant in that it teaches how to structure representation learning to improve clustering quality and avoid spurious correlations. For SNP beta or Z-score clustering, the concepts of decorrelation, instance discrimination adapted for association signals, and spectral clustering approximations could be very useful. However, since it is designed for images, adapting it to SNPs will require careful redesign of the feature construction and similarity notions.",
