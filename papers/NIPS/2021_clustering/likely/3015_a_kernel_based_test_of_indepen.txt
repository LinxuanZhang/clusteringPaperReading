  "title": "A Kernel-based Test of Independence for Cluster-correlated Data",
  "summary": "This paper extends the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to handle cluster-correlated data, proposing HSICcl. By adjusting for intra-cluster correlation, the authors derive the asymptotic distribution of the HSIC statistic under null and alternative hypotheses. They provide a practical testing procedure and show through simulation studies and real-world microbiome data that HSICcl effectively controls type I error and achieves higher power than competing methods. The method is kernel-based, nonparametric, and robust to complex, non-linear dependence patterns.",
  "classification": "Likely helpful",
  "relevance": "Although HSICcl is developed for independence testing rather than clustering, its kernel-based framework and accommodation of clustered, noisy data are highly relevant for SNP clustering. The insights into constructing robust similarity measures and handling correlated data can inform the design of specialized SNP clustering algorithms that detect true biological signals and isolate noise clusters. Therefore, this paper is moderately useful, especially for the methodological aspects of kernel design and robustness.",
