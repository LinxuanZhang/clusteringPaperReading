  "title": "Hierarchical Clustering: O(1)-Approximation for Well-Clustered Graphs",
  "summary": "This paper develops two efficient hierarchical clustering algorithms with constant-factor (O(1)) approximation guarantees relative to Dasgupta's cost function. One method targets high-conductance graphs via simple degree-based clustering, while the main contribution (PruneMerge) applies to well-clustered graphs by using spectral partitioning, critical node pruning, and careful merging. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets show strong improvements over prior work, particularly when cluster structures are heterogeneous or noisy.",
  "classification": "Very helpful",
  "relevance": "The paper's techniques for efficiently clustering well-separated, heterogeneous clusters are directly applicable to the challenge of SNP clustering for Mendelian randomisation. Concepts like critical node pruning, spectral decomposition, and minimizing cross-cluster noise provide a powerful basis for designing an SNP clustering algorithm that can robustly group meaningful SNPs while isolating noise clusters. Minor adaptations are needed to handle SNP-specific similarity structures.",
