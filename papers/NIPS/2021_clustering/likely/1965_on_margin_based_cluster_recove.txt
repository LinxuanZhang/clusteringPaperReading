  "title": "On Margin-Based Cluster Recovery with Oracle Queries",
  "summary": "This paper studies how to exactly recover clusters using a minimal number of oracle queries under various notions of margin separation. It introduces the convex hull margin (allowing efficient recovery using convex hull expansion) and one-versus-all margin (generalizing to pseudometric spaces). Two algorithms, CHEATREC and MREC, are proposed with strong theoretical guarantees, achieving exact cluster recovery with only O(log n) queries under margin conditions. The paper establishes deep connections between margin assumptions, active learning, and cluster recoverability.",
  "classification": "Very helpful",
  "relevance": "The paper's introduction of margin-based recovery techniques is highly relevant for SNP clustering where spurious associations must be isolated. The convex hull margin and convex hull expansion trick could be adapted to cluster SNPs based on effect-size measures like beta or Z-scores. The one-versus-all margin concept generalizes well to noisy or less structured data, resembling the challenges in SNP clustering for Mendelian randomization. Though originally aimed at active query learning, the techniques offer powerful ideas for developing robust, noise-tolerant SNP clustering algorithms.",
