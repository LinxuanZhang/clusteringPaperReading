  "title": "Deep Conditional Gaussian Mixture Model for Constrained Clustering",
  "summary": "This paper introduces DC-GMM, a deep generative model for constrained clustering that integrates domain knowledge in the form of probabilistic pairwise constraints. Using a VAE framework with a Gaussian Mixture Model prior, DC-GMM modifies the traditional ELBO objective to incorporate constraint information, allowing for soft, uncertain relationships between data points. The method achieves state-of-the-art clustering performance across image, text, and real-world medical datasets, and shows strong robustness to noisy constraint data. Its generative structure allows for not only clustering but also data generation and uncertainty estimation.",
  "classification": "Very helpful",
  "relevance": "DC-GMM directly addresses the challenge of clustering noisy or partially-labeled data using prior knowledge, making it highly relevant for SNP clustering tasks where beta or Z-score measures can serve as soft constraints. Its ability to model uncertainty in the constraints and its flexible, probabilistic structure provide a solid foundation for adapting it to cluster SNPs for causal inference while detecting noise clusters. Some adaptation would be needed to encode association measures into the modelâ€™s constraint format, but the overall framework is a strong match for the goals of clustering SNPs into instruments for Mendelian randomization.",
