  "title": "Nearly-Tight and Oblivious Algorithms for Explainable Clustering",
  "summary": "This paper presents randomized algorithms for producing explainable clusterings with minimal loss in clustering quality compared to optimal, non-explainable clusterings. The algorithms create threshold trees based only on cluster centers, ignoring individual data points. They achieve nearly optimal guarantees for k-medians and k-means objectives and show strong lower bounds on how much worse explainable clustering must be. The methods are simple, fast, oblivious to data points, and robust to overfitting.",
  "classification": "Likely helpful",
  "relevance": "Although the focus is on explainability via decision trees, the algorithm's oblivious, center-based, and randomized structure offers valuable ideas for clustering SNPs using association measures like Z-scores or betas. Its robustness and efficiency make it a promising foundation, but adaptations would be needed for noise detection and biological relevance interpretation.",
