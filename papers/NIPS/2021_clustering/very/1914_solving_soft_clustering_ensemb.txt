  "title": "Solving Soft Clustering Ensemble via k-Sparse Discrete Wasserstein Barycenter",
  "summary": "This paper proposes solving the soft clustering ensemble problem by linking it to the k-sparse Discrete Wasserstein Barycenter (DWB) problem. The authors introduce efficient sampling-based algorithms with provable approximation guarantees to find a consensus clustering from multiple soft clusterings. Their approach significantly improves both computational efficiency and clustering quality. They also provide a detailed theoretical analysis proving that with enough input clusterings, the consensus solution converges to the ground truth. Their experiments demonstrate strong performance against classic ensemble methods across multiple datasets.",
  "classification": "Very helpful",
  "relevance": "This paper is highly relevant for designing SNP clustering algorithms. It directly addresses the challenge of aggregating noisy clustering information, using a robust and interpretable metric (Wasserstein distance). The use of soft clustering aligns with the probabilistic nature of SNP associations across multiple pathways. The framework is scalable and provably consistent, making it well-suited for SNP-level beta or Z-score data clustering, with potential to isolate noise clusters naturally.",
